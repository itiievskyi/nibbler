# Nibbler (42 School Project)
Nibbler is yet another snake video game written in C++ including a major twist: dynamic libraries. The goal is splitted in 4 parts : a main executable and 3 dynamic libraries that main executable will load and use at runtime. Each library will embed everything the main executable might need to display the game and to get the playerâ€™s inputs. The main executable will only focus on the game logic and interact with the dynamic libraries. The main executable must interact in a identical way with any of your libraries.ies.
